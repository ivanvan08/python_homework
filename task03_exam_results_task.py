Task 3 â€” Class Exam Results ğŸ“Š

Requirements:
  - grades = [45, 72, 88, 91, 60, 55]
  - Compute average using a loop (avoid sum())
  - Gather grades strictly above the average into a new list
  - Print the average and the list

Practice: loop aggregation, conditional filtering

OUTPUT EXAMPLE
--------------
Average: 68.50
Above average: [72, 88, 91]
