Task 7 â€” ATM Cash Dispenser ðŸ”¢

Requirements:
  - bills = [100, 50, 20, 10]
  - For amount = 180, calculate greedy breakdown
  - Print like: "1x100, 1x50, 1x20, 1x10"
  - If not divisible by 10, print an error message

Practice: loops, integer division, modulo, conditional handling

OUTPUT EXAMPLE
--------------
1x100, 1x50, 1x20, 1x10
